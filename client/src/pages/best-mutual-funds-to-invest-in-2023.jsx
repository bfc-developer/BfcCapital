          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
          <p>Moving forward, we will list some schemes that have been doing exceptionally well in their respective categories and also educate you on what makes a good plan better. However, investors should make note that no such projection is ever absolute. Mutual Fund yields are dependent on market trajectory and certain other economic factors and, therefore, should be picked after proper professional consultation.</p>

          <h2>Best Mutual Funds: Reality or Myth ?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>So, how does one identify the Best Mutual Funds for 2023? Does such a thing even exist ?</p>
          <p>To be honest, best Mutual Funds could be a thing if the investor has access to the right advice, and the will to act on it, and a myth, if not. See, there are no readymade “best” Mutual Fund schemes. Variables such as investor priorities, monetary liabilities, income levels, investment objectives, etc, need to be factored in to diagnose if a certain mutual fund plan can fit into an individual’s scheme of things.</p>
          <p>Every investor is unique, and so are their objectives. Therefore, their priorities, monetary liabilities, income levels, objectives, etc., must be taken into account before opting for a Mutual Fund scheme. For instance, a 25-year-old looking to purchase a car can entertain the thought of chasing returns since he has time and age on his side. Consequently, he can invest in relatively ambitious schemes to achieve the targeted corpus much before the intended deadline. A homemaker, on the other hand, who just wants to keep safe the money she has saved over time, may not want to be that adventurous, and therefore would opt for a scheme that offers consistent returns whilst keeping her invested corpus intact.</p>
          <p>Simply put, the best Mutual Funds schemes are those that are in alignment with the investor’s objectives, limitations and goals. </p>

          <h2>How to Select the Best Mutual Funds ?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>There are no "best" mutual fund schemes for the simple reason that each individual's needs are unique. A scheme that works well for one investor may not work well for another.</p>
          <p>Consider a service class investor nearing retirement. In all likelihood, such an investor will prefer to invest in a scheme that promises to preserve his capital while providing him with much-needed returns. A younger professional, on the other hand, will have more time on his side, allowing him to be more adventurous in his investment strategy and pursue higher returns.</p>
          <p>Prioritizing is the best way to start shortlisting mutual funds for investment. Among other things, one must gain clarity on their investment purpose, the amount they need to set aside for this purpose, and the duration for which they can stay invested. These variables must be communicated to the professional assisting the investor in shortlisting a mutual fund scheme so the latter can outline a compatible investment plan.</p>

          <h2>Benefits of Investing in Best Mutual Funds for 2023 </h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>Ultimately, everyone wants to invest in an asset class that offers manifold returns, which is why Mutual Funds are investors' favourites. There are just too many benefits of investing in the Best Mutual Funds. Read on to find out:</p>
          <p><b>Professional Money Management</b></p>
          <p>Mutual Funds are managed by qualified fund managers, each backed by a team of analysts to research the market and predict its ups and downs, saving the investors the trouble of managing their finances.</p>
          <p><b>Pocket-friendly Investing</b></p>
          <p>Mutual fund investments are easy on the pocket, and investors can accumulate considerable wealth by investing in Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). Consequently, they don't have to make unnecessary sacrifices to accommodate the investment. And the best part is that they can figure out the amount they need to invest for a specific objective using an <a href="/sip-calculator" target="_blank" className="text-bold text-primary"><u>SIP Calculator</u></a>. </p>
          <p><b>Automatic Diversification</b></p>
          <p>Mutual funds invest their accumulated corpus in various assets, allowing investors the luxury of diversifying, bringing down their risk liability whilst maximizing the returns they earn. </p>
          <p><b>Healthy Returns</b></p>
          <p>Mutual funds work on the principles of compounding and thus have the potential to show exponentional growth over the long term. Simply put, the more time the invested money spends in the market, the more it is likely to grow.</p>
          <p><b>Ready Liquidity</b></p>
          <p>Liquidity is the ease with which an individual can convert an investment into cash. Mutual Funds facilitate quick redemptions, meaning an investor can easily redeem units from his mutual fund scheme online or offline. The liquidated units are transferred to the investor’s bank account within a few days.</p>
          <p><b>Tax Efficiency</b></p>
          <p>Certain Mutual Fund schemes (ELSS Plans) offer tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Along with this, under such schemes, investors are also eligible for a yearly tax exemption of up to Rs. 1 Lakh on LTCG (Long term Capital Gains). However, if the gains exceed the Rs. 1 Lakh threshold, the investors are liable to pay LTCG tax at a mere 10%.</p>

          <h2>What are the risks associated with investing in a Mutual Fund?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>Mutual Funds are invested in various asset classes, due to which they are susceptible to market fluctuations. These market fluctuations can lead to potential losses; therefore, analyzing the risks associated with investing in mutual funds is necessary. Listed below are the risks that accompany mutual funds.</p>
          <p><b>Market Risk</b></p>
          <p>Market risk arises due to the underperformance of the market, which could lead to losses for mutual fund investors. Several reasons can be responsible for the poor performance, like a pandemic, global slowdown, inflation, and so on, making life difficult for investors.</p>
          <p><b>Concentration Risk</b></p>
          <p> Concentration basically means focusing on one thing, and so does concentration risk. When mutual fund schemes invest their entire accumulated corpus in one asset class, the risk factor is greater. The best way to avoid such threats is diversifying the portfolio. The more spread out the portfolio, the lesser at risk it shall be.</p>
          <p><b>Interest Rate Risk</b></p>
          <p>The fluctuation in a debt fund's NAV due to changes in interest rates is known as Interest Rate Risk. Whenever interest rates rise, debt funds experience an drop in their NAV, meaning the two are inversely related.</p>
          <p><b>Liquidity Risk</b></p>
          <p>Liquidity risk refers to the inability to redeem units from a mutual fund scheme. This usually happens when a seller is unable to find a buyer for the security or when the investment is made in an ELSS scheme that has a mandatory three-year lock-in period.</p>
          <p><b>Credit Risk</b></p>
          <p>When the issuer of a bond purchased is unable to pay the promised interest it is referred to as Credit Risk. Investors can evaluate credit risk by analyzing the credit ratings awarded to the scheme by credit rating agencies.</p>

          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>Many investors make the mistake of investing in Mutual Fund schemes based on previous returns. Investors should refrain from investing in table-topper funds, simply because the first-hand research required to identify suitable schemes goes beyond comparing previous returns.</p>
          <p>It is worth noting that top mutual funds keep changing on a daily basis, across categories, depending upon market highs and lows. Meaning, the mutual fund presently topping the charts may not make top 10 the very next day or week. Therefore, investing in a scheme just because of its ranking is a flawed approach.  Mutual Funds should only be shortlisted after thorough research, that too by someone who knows what he/she is doing.</p>
