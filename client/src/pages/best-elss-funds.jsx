          <h2>Best ELSS Funds</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
          <p>Let’s just start by understanding the basics of ELSS funds. In simple terms, ELSS funds are Mutual Funds that offer tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. As mandated by regulatory bodies, they invest a majority of their accumulated corpus in equity or equity-related instruments. What makes this asset class desirable is its tendency to deliver healthy returns. However, given the volatility equity markets are subjected to, certain dos and don’ts have to be kept in mind before infusing capital in this asset class. Let’s find those out.</p>

          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>Given the number of economic influences and vulnerabilities the equity market is susceptible to, it is advisable that all fundamentals fuelling an ELSS scheme’s growth be observed closely and scrutinised for irregularities or flaws in compounding strategy before investing.</p>
          <p>Investors also need to assure that the underlying funds of the ELSS scheme in their portfolio are monitored and switched if required to avoid any kickbacks from the global market. Also, the tax benefits offered under the scheme and the quantum of investment should be sufficient to accommodate the tax liability the investor is to attract.</p>
          <p>In simple terms, the best ELSS Funds are those that match investment objectives and do not compromise on returns on the pretext of offering tax benefits.</p>

        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>ELSS funds have a lock-in period, which means there is little an investor can do if his funds are parked in the wrong scheme, which is why when it comes to investing in ELSS plans, seeking professional assistance is the only way to go. Each investor must be isolated and diagnosed separately for obligations and liabilities before a financial solution can be tailored to their specific needs.</p>
          <p>Herein, the first step is to prioritise. Among other things, one must be clear on their investment goal; is it simply to save money on taxes, or are they aiming for a specific volume of gains? In addition, the amount they wish to accumulate, the duration of their investment, and the estimated tax outgo must all be considered. These variables must be communicated to the professional assisting the investor in order to shortlist an ELSS plan compatible with the former's risk profile.</p>

          <h2>Who should invest in ELSS Mutual Funds ?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>ELSS Mutual Funds help investors save money on taxes. However, selecting an investment option that suits them best can be challenging. Read on to figure out who should invest in ELSS funds.</p>
          <p><b>People Looking to Save Tax</b></p>
          <p>Everyone wants to save money on taxes, and ELSS funds are the most suitable tax-saving options. Investments made in ELSS Funds qualify for annual tax deductions of up to Rs.1,50,000. The asset class is an absolute favourite among salaried and business class investors. Also, any gains made under ELSS Funds are identified as long-term capital gains and therefore are tax-free up to a limit of Rs. 1,00,000. The gains made over and above this threshold are taxed at a mere 10%.</p>
          <p><b>Wealth Accumulation</b></p>
          <p>ELSS Funds are an ideal wealth-building tool for people who can stay invested for long. Investors with a relatively high-risk appetite and willingness to stay invested for longer periods can accumulate wealth over time. This means they can benefit from the power of compounding by allowing the investment enough time to grow.</p>
          <p><b>Those Planning a Purchase</b></p>
          <p>ELSS funds are an ideal stepping stone for those planning a purchase or eyeing a goal, be it short or long term, due to their tendency to generate better returns. When allowed sufficient time to grow and managed actively, the Best ELSS funds can fetch above-normal returns, helping investors achieve their long and short-term objectives, from buying a house or car purchase to retirement and child education planning. However, investors must seek professional help before investing in ELSS schemes, ensuring that the investment is monitored actively by a certified professional.</p>

          <h2>Benefits of Investing in ELSS Mutual Funds</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p> There are multiple Benefits of Investing in ELSS Mutual Funds. Listed below are some of those-</p>
          <p><b>Tax Saving </b></p>
          <p>One of the primary benefits of investing in ELSS mutual funds is tax saving. ELSS schemes enjoy tax benefits listed under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. As per the governing provisions, investors can claim a tax deduction of up to Rs 1,50,000 a year by investing in ELSS schemes, saving up to Rs 46,800 a year on taxes.</p>
          <p><b>Better Post-Tax Returns</b></p>
          <p>Long-term capital gains made from ELSS are tax-free up to a limit of Rs. 1,00,000. Also, gains made over and above this limit are taxed at 10% only. In short, lower tax rates and higher returns ensure the best-possible post-tax returns.</p>
          <p><b>High Returns</b></p>
          <p>Inherently, ELSS investments are vulnerable to market fluctuations. However, this vulnerability can be used to the investor's advantage if the investment is given enough time to grow in the market. Over time, ELSS funds benefit from compounding laws and produce higher returns.</p>
          <p><b>Multiple Investment Modes</b></p>
          <p>Investors can enter ELSS schemes in one go by making a one-time lump sum investment, or they can invest in portions through regular monthly contributions via an SIP plan. This "flexibility" is what makes ELSS schemes an investor favourite.</p>

        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p> The best investment plans are those that offer consistent returns over the long term. Sometimes, however, the ELSS schemes topping the charts descend the rankings and never recover, meaning they're inconsistent performers. The fact that ELSS plans come with a 3-year lock-in period only compounds the problem, as the investor cannot salvage the money parked in the fund for the time being. So, it is safe to assume that there are other parameters besides previous yields to shortlist ELSS funds for investment.</p>
