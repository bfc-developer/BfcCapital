          <p>Mutual Funds are among the smartest ways to save tax since they have the flexibility needed to avail tax benefits in a pocket-friendly manner. This asset class allows investors to save tax by parking small manageable amounts through the year and accumulate the savings needed to avail the tax benefits offered under the Income Tax Act. There are, however, some doubts that accompany tax saving mutual funds. Let's clarify those doubts.</p>

          <h2>What are Tax-Saving Mutual Funds and how do they work ?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>Tax Saving Mutual Funds, commonly known as ELSS (Equity Linked Saving Schemes), are like other mutual fund schemes and manifest gains over time. The only difference between tax-saving mutual funds and other mutual fund schemes is that they offer the additional benefit of tax saving. These funds are eligible for tax rebates under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.</p>
          <p> Typically, the investments made under tax-saving mutual funds are equity-linked, and help investors create wealth and achieve higher returns. Most of the tax-saving mutual funds are ELSS schemes, and offer investors a tax rebate of up to Rs. 1,50,000, helping them save up to Rs 46,800 on taxes every year. Also, investments in tax-saving mutual funds are usually made in the multi-cap category.</p>
          <p>How do they work?</p>
          <p>Tax-saving mutual funds combine the money of several investors and invest it ahead in the equity market. ELSS Funds have a mandatory three-year lock-in period, and the investor cannot liquidate the investment before the conclusion of the lock-in.</p>
          <p>Also, the lock-in period for each individual installment is three years, starting from the day the contribution was made. For example, if the first installment was made on August 1, 2020, and the second was made on September 1, 2020, then on August 1, 2023, the lock-in for only the first installment will end, whereas the second one will end on September 1, 2023.</p>

          <h2>How to choose and invest in Tax Saving Mutual Funds ?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p> Choosing the best investment schemes and figuring out the amount that will be saved can be a task. Investors can start by gaining an idea of the amount of tax they can save when investing in tax-saving mutual funds using an <a href="/elss-calculator" target="_blank" className="text-bold text-primary"> <u>ELSS Calculator</u></a>. Listed below are some other pointers investors must consider before choosing to invest in tax-saving mutual funds or ELSS Funds.</p>
          <p><b>Investor's Risk Profile</b></p>
          <p>Since ELSS Funds are equity-linked, they are vulnerable to market fluctuations. Hence, before choosing them as an investment alternative, investors should carefully analyze their risk-taking capacity and check the structure of their current portfolio. The best investments are those that are compatible with the investor's profile.</p>
          <p><b>Scheme / Fund History</b></p>
          <p>Although a scheme's previous performance does not guarantee future returns, it often helps investors get a fair idea of what they are getting into. An efficient fund history suggests that the funds are well-managed and free of compliance concerns.</p>
          <p><b>Previous Performance of Fund House</b></p>
          <p>When selecting a tax-saving mutual fund, it is important to check the previous performance of the fund house or AMC. Investors must compare the performance of funds previously floated by the AMC before finalizing the best possible alternative.</p>
          <p><b>Professional Recommendation</b></p>
          <p>Choosing and investing in ELSS Funds can be challenging at times, and therefore, it is advisable to get professional assistance. Usually, mutual fund distributors are equipped with the tools needed to evaluate schemes based on all the necessary parameters.</p>
          <p><b>How to invest in tax-saving mutual funds?</b></p>
          <p>Investing in tax-saving mutual funds or ELSS schemes is similar to investing in other mutual funds. However, to invest in mutual funds, an investor needs to be KYC compliant. One can invest in tax-saving mutual funds through online platforms like <a href="/download-app" target="_blank" className="text-bold text-primary"> <u> PRODIGY Pro</u> </a>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Log into the <a href="/download-app" target="_blank" className="text-bold text-primary"> <u> PRODIGY Pro</u></a> app</li>
            {/* <li>Pick the mutual fund from the various fund houses available</li> */}
            <li>Pick a tax-saving mutual fund that best suits your risk profile and investment objective.</li>
            <li>Select the amount you are planning to invest towards the fund and the investment mode, i.e. via an SIP or in a lump sum.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Apart from this, one can also invest in tax-saving mutual funds directly through an AMC or via a mutual fund distributor. To create an account with the AMC, investors must provide all the necessary details like their name, mobile number, identification documents, etc.</p>

          <p><b>Shortest Lock-In Period</b></p>
          <p>ELSS Funds have the shortest lock-in period as opposed to other tax-saving options i.e. 3 years. For instance, PPF schemes have a mandatory lock-in of 5 years.</p>

          <h2>Tax Saving Mutual Funds and PPF: A Comparison</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p> PPF investments are widely considered a safer bet when it comes to investing for tax saving purposes, given their asynchronicity to equity markets. That said, there is a large section of investors that invests in tax saving mutual funds. Let's see how they both fare on various parameters.</p>
          <p>The returns offered under PPF presently are around 7-8 % a year. As per the data of last 10 years, tax saving Mutual Funds offer returns in the range of 12 to 14%.</p>
          <p>Yes, PPF investments are tax exempted, accumulation and withdrawal included. Tax saving mutual funds, on the other hand, attract 10 per cent LTCG tax. However, the smart investor knows that this levy is subject to the condition that the returns manifested after a holding period of one year exceed Rs. 1 Lakh. Meaning, the amount invested in tax saving funds can be adjusted to keep the returns below the Rs. 1 Lakh threshold and consequently the 10 per cent levy can be avoided.</p>
          <p>Also, PPF investments carry a lock-in of 15 years (one can withdraw partially after 5 years), which means the money invested is frozen through the investment tenure. Tax saving funds, on the other hand, have just a 3-year lock-in, making them better on the liquidity front.</p>
          <p>Besides this, PPF schemes have an upper ceiling in terms of the tenure and quantum of investment allowed. The maximum tenure allowed under PPF schemes is 15 years with an acceptable extension of another 5 years. The maximum quantum of investment allowed stands at Rs. 1,50,000 a year. Tax saving funds, however, do not carry any such ceiling and grant investors the flexibility needed to save tax as per their monitory obligations.</p>

          <h2>Lock-in Under Tax Saving Mutual Funds</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p> Most tax-saving investments are accompanied by a mandatory lock-in, wherein the money parked in the investment is frozen from liquidation, meaning the investor cannot maneuver or liquidate units until the conclusion of the lock-in period. Take for example, PPF investments- these come with a mandatory lock-in of 5 years. Tax saving mutual funds, specifically ELSS funds, have the shortest lock-in of 3 years, as opposed to its other tax-saving counterparts. This, however, does not mean that the investor should exit the investment immediately after the lock-in period ends. One can and should continue the acquisition, provided the fund’s performance and its market impact have been declared satisfactory by a certified professional.</p>
          <p>If need be, one can re-invest the units redeemed, provided the prevalent market dynamics and the investor’s monetary profile allow, which again shall have to be validated by a professional.</p>
          <p>Long story short, keeping the money invested for long durations is the advisable strategy when it comes to Mutual Funds, tax savers or not.</p>

        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p> When it comes to deploying funds for tax saving, these days investors are spoiled for choice. They can go for Small Saving Schemes like PPF, EPF, etc, opt for an FD in a bank, or buy a Life Insurance Policy for availing the dual benefit of Tax Saving and Risk Cover.</p>
          <p>Why then should one overlook these time-tested options and go for an instrument like Tax Saving Mutual Funds, and expose his hard-earned money to the volatility of markets? </p>
          <p>Yes, Tax Saving Mutual Funds can be a tad volatile and selecting or reviewing them does demand a certain know-how, but what they offer in exchange is much more than what they demand. </p>
          <p>Firstly, they offer the minimum mandatory lock-in period amongst all Tax Saving Instruments - 3 years to be precise. Secondly, they offer the convenience of deploying and withdrawing money within minutes, in as little as 2-3 clicks. Lastly and most importantly, they offer something all of us want - Better Returns! </p>
