                <p>Equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS) is a mutual fund category that offers tax rebates to investors under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. ELSS mutual funds are investor favourites due to their high return potential.</p>

              <Accordion.Body>
                <p>ELSS funds are slightly volatile since most investments made in ELSS Funds are equity-linked, making them prone to market fluctuations. However, the volatility can be managed through active monitoring and by allowing the investment sufficient time in the market.</p>
